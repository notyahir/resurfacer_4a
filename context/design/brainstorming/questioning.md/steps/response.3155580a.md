# response:

The ability to stop time is incredibly powerful, and this is best demonstrated in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, specifically in Part 3: Stardust Crusaders. In the final battle between Jotaro v. Dio, Dio reveals his ability to stop time, which at first is only for a brief moment and then evolves into seconds. As it is show, the seconds are dramatized to be a lot longer but the idea is that the power is ever-evolving.

If you wanted to have complete control over time with no strain on the user, the ability becomes even more powerful. With the ability to stop time, you can prevent any accident, or get yourself out of many sticky situations. You can launch infinite attacks, block infinite attacks, and render things that would affect you in an instant useless. The ability to stop time lets you ponder on your next action in real moving-time.

The only possible negation to this power is an ability stronger than this such as the ability to speed up time. If an enemy is ability to speed up time, the perception of time itself is shortened and so if the user can only stop time for a few seconds in normal time perception, it gets dramatically reduced in the reframed perception of time caused by the enemy user.
