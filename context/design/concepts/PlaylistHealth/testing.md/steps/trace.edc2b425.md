# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the `PlaylistHealth` concept fulfills its principle by taking a snapshot of a user's playlist and generating a report with actionable findings, all within a self-contained unit.

1. **User initiates a playlist check.** A user wants to clean up their playlist and initiates a health check. This translates to an initial action on the `PlaylistHealth` concept.

2. **`snapshot` action occurs.** The system calls `snapshot` with the user's ID, the playlist's ID, and an array of track IDs from that playlist. This specific array contains known issues: a duplicate track `track:A`, an unavailable track represented by `null`, and a track at the 7th position that will be flagged as a placeholder outlier.

   ```typescript
   // Input to the action
   const playlistData = {
     playlistId: "playlist:1",
     userId: "user:A",
     trackIds: ["track:A", "track:B", "track:C", "track:A", null, "track:E", "track:F"],
   };
   const { snapshotId } = await playlistHealth.snapshot(playlistData);
   ```

   * **Effect**: A new `Snapshot` document is created and stored in the database, freezing the state of the playlist at this moment in time. The concept returns the unique `snapshotId`.

3. **`analyze` action occurs.** With the `snapshotId` from the previous step, the system requests an analysis.

   ```typescript
   const { reportId } = await playlistHealth.analyze({
     playlistId: "playlist:1",
     snapshotId: snapshotId,
   });
   ```

   * **Effect**: The concept retrieves the specified snapshot. It iterates through the `trackIds`, identifying and collecting findings:
     * It sees `track:A` at index 3 is a repeat of the one at index 0 and creates a `Duplicate` finding.
     * It sees `null` at index 4 and creates an `Unavailable` finding.
     * It sees `track:F` at index 6 (the 7th item) and creates an `Outlier` finding based on its internal placeholder logic.
   * A new `Report` document containing these findings is created and stored. The unique `reportId` is returned.

4. **`getReport` action occurs.** The system now fetches the completed report to display the results to the user.

   ```typescript
   const { findings } = await playlistHealth.getReport({ reportId });
   ```

   * **Effect**: The concept retrieves the `Report` document and returns its contents. The returned `findings` array accurately reflects the issues detected in the `analyze` step:
     * `{ idx: 3, trackId: 'track:A', kind: 'Duplicate' }`
     * `{ idx: 4, trackId: null, kind: 'Unavailable' }`
     * `{ idx: 6, trackId: 'track:F', kind: 'Outlier' }`

This trace successfully demonstrates the **principle**: a snapshot was provided, and the concept independently computed findings without any external dependencies, fulfilling its purpose of detecting playlist issues.
