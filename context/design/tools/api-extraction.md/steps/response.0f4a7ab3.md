# response:

Of course. Based on the provided specification and implementation for the `PlatformLink` concept, here is its extracted API.

To complete the full API for the application, please provide the specification and implementation files for the remaining four concepts: `LibraryCache`, `TrackScoring`, `SwipeSessions`, and `PlaylistHealth`. The markdown-style links in the prompt (`[@LibraryCache]...`) are not accessible.

Once you provide the remaining concepts, I can generate the complete API in the same format.
