# Backend changes (stability + spec adherence)

This summarizes backend updates in second half of 4b. The aim was to stop 500s on `/api/SwipeSessions/next`, improve the inputs, and make API behavior explicit while keeping the public concept API intact.

## What changed

- Stronger input validation in `SwipeSessions.start`
	- Trim `userId`; reject empty values with clear `{ error: "User ID cannot be empty" }`.
	- Require `queueTracks` to be an array; trim each entry and drop empties; reject if none remain.
	- If `size` is provided, require a positive integer and ensure enough tracks are available
	- Persist only clean, trimmed IDs in the session document.

- Safe queue handling in `SwipeSessions.next`
	- When the queue is exhausted or invalid, return `{ trackId: "-1" }` instead of throwing—removes the 500s that surfaced as "no healthy upstream".
	- Idempotent index updates prevent out-of-bounds reads.

- Decision validation normalization in `_makeDecision`
	- Normalize the incoming `trackId` and compare to the last-served track.
	- Store normalized IDs in `decisions` for consistency.


- The API is now utilizing the code more directly. We recreated the API to try and get SwipeSession's actions working again which we tested on Postman. 

## Notes

Despite Resurfacer being in a working state where things make sense and can function. I know that there still exists a lot of potential for the system to be refined and to add more visual details that would be useful for the user. 

One of the issues that I have always struggled with as a programmer is trying to do a bit of EVERYTHING rather than focusing on SOMETHING and doing it well. In this case, I didn’t want to try and go overboard on adding details and running into more possibilities of errors. In that case, I maintained a minimal design, which is already my style, and added what would be needed for functionality. With AI-augmented concepts to be implemented, it will only be more and more refined!
